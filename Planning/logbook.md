# Daily progress logbook

## Day 1 13/8/'22

Today we worked on Initial planning. Setting up the Planning folder. Creating user stories. Setting up trello entering user stories and other startup to do tasks. Afterwards I began with the task of reading up on the different technologies we will use. To do this today I looked into the documentation of React, the DOM, some Javascript and I watched a few videos on server side rendering. I am excited to start the project but I must say I am also unsure about how I will do.

I have also been brainstorming page layouts and a possible name for the website. Next I read documentation from PostgreSQL
As well as some more React
